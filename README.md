# üìë How to `fastn`?

This workshop is a part of the [EduHub Roadshow Jaipur](https://lu.ma/college-roadshow) organized [EduHub Community](https://eduhubcommunity.tech)

The `README.md` is intentional to assist you the explorer on their way to explore their project *while* or after the workshop!

## üìÇ File Structure

```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Other Files

```
.github/
-- workflows/
---- deploy.yml - github pages deployment action

.vscode/
-- settings.json - contains some vscode settings

.editorconfig - contains basic editor config

.gitignore - mentions the files that ignored by git

renovate.json - created by github app `renovate`, used for dependency upgrades in nodejs and other languages, does nothing in fastn!

```

## üíª Technology Used

This project is built to demonstrate the [`fastn`](https://fastn.com) framework and uses the FTD (fifth try document) language since fastn supports it!

It also uses GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages for deployment.

- Now you have VSCode on the web to work on this repo üéâ

- Go to `FASTN.ftd` file

  This file is the package manager, if you gave the repo name anything other than `workshop-fastn` please update all the times `workshop-fastn` is written to your repository's name for it to work!

- Open the terminal (`CTRL` + `\``) and run:

  ```bash
  bash
  source <(curl -fsSL https://fastn.com/install.sh) # installs fastn on the codespace
  # restart terminal or run "source ~/.bashrc" on linux
  fastn serve # this will start the fastn server which you can view with the link provided
  ```

- Go to `FASTN/data.ftd` file

- Have a look around the code, try to change the texts and links to make them all yours ‚ú®

- Look at the running version of fastn server and see how it looks ü§ì

- Now have a look at `index.ftd`! This is the real fastn code, the other is just variables. Read it out and I'm sure you'll understand what it is

- Boom! üî• you made your very own fastn website

- Now open the terminal again, click on the plus icon (top right of the terminal) to create a new instance

- Run the following commands to commit your changes:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "my small mini link in bio"
  git push
  ```

- Now go back to your GitHub Repository, on the settings tab, then the `pages` button on the menu

- Now open the select option for the branch and select `gh-pages`

  ![](https://github.com/xkrishguptaa/workshop-fastn/assets/135469703/ac88830a-1986-4dd9-ad20-0953b1e4ac56)

- Save and you are done! Your website will soon be live at `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/workshop-fastn`
